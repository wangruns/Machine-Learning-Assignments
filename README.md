K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for example:

## What is k nearest neighbor
K nearest neighbor is a based algorithm for classification and regression. In this experiment we only implement k nearest neighbor algorithm for classification. Given a new input sample, then find the k samples which are nearest away from the new input sample in the training set, they are defined as k nearest neighbors, finally we will make decision according to the k nearest neighbors, that is to say if most of the k nearest neighbors are apple, so we will classify the new input sample as apple as well. Thatâ€™s the core concept of this algorithm as far as I am concerned.

Now we have already know something about what k nearest neighbor is, the next thing we need to know is: 

* **How to choose the value of k.**
* **How to define the nearest.**
* **How to find the k samples or elements.**

Linear Regression Algorithm for example:

## What is linear regression
As far as I am concerned, Linear regression is a function composed of some single variences whose power is 1. Say that we have n featrues for our sample, so we can write our linear regression hypothesis model as:

h=theta0 + theta1\*x1 + theta2\*x2 + ...thetan\*xn
